Firecracker must be built on the target architecture. For example, for
aarch64, you must either have an arm development host, or spin up
a qemu arm VM.

You will need to add the patch that supports arbitrary path names
for the macvtap interfaces.
	0001-Add-prototype-support-for-macvtap-interfaces.patch

You may also need to back out commit 76528ea49b76b994d38e6cbef2a6bda6121564d7
	"aarch64: setup cache topology"
if your target does not provide the cache architecture entries in the FDT
that this commit is looking for. Upstream has no decision on how to
handle this bug.

To build:
	tools/devtool build --release
