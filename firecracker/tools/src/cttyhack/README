In a busybox shell, there is no controlling terminal by default.
To work around this, busybox has an external utility that can be
compliled in named cttyhack. This utility performs the necessary
TIOC ioctls to allow signals (most notably ^C) to be correctly
handled.

This comes from the busybox source:git://git.busybox.net/busybox
under ./shell/cttyhack.c , and has been modified to compile standalone.
